# Project Plan

## 1. Core Chunk Server Enhancements

- Finalize entity migration with retries/backoff, validation, and secure inter-server transfers.
- Expand pathfinding for block-level terrain costs, flying/ground modes, and underground traversal.
- Add voxel/entity streaming rate limiting to protect main servers.
- Build automated tests for stability, migration, and pathfinding subsystems.
- Implement periodic chunk snapshots with incremental replay to accelerate restarts and disaster recovery.
- Introduce chaos and fault-injection tests for migration queues and neighbor handshakes to validate resilience.

## 2. Central Orchestrator Growth

- Harden chunk-server lifecycle management (health checks, auto-restart, rolling updates).
- Persist world layout/server metadata (e.g., PostgreSQL or etcd) for restarts and scaling.
- Provide authenticated APIs for chunk lookup, admin operations, and player routing.
- Integrate resource monitoring (CPU, memory, voxel deltas) for autoscaling decisions.
- Add multi-region routing policies and latency-aware server selection for geographically distributed players.
- Build disaster-recovery tooling to replay orchestrator state from persisted metadata and chunk snapshots.

## 3. Client/Player Integration

- Deliver a player gateway that consults the central orchestrator and relays pathing/terrain data.
- Create SDKs/sample clients (Go/TypeScript) for lookup, path requests, and chunk deltas.
- Implement connection handoff logic so clients switch chunk servers seamlessly when crossing boundaries.
- Deliver client-side caching and reconciliation logic so brief disconnects do not interrupt entity updates.
- Provide accessibility options (colorblind-safe overlays, configurable HUD) in sample clients to broaden usability.

## 4. World Simulation Features

- Deepen block physics (collapses, explosive propagation, structural supports) with configurable rules.
- Extend voxel delta pipeline to support compression, prioritization near players, and undo logs.
- Add world generation plug-ins (biomes, resource veins, underground tunnels) deterministic across chunk boundaries.
- Simulate dynamic weather and time-of-day cycles that influence lighting, physics, and entity behaviors.
- Model advanced AI behaviors (formations, squad tactics, construction planning) that coordinate across chunks.

## 5. Operational Tooling

- Package chunk servers and central orchestrator via Docker or service managers for deployment ease.
- Provide CLI utilities for cluster admin (launch, drain, migrate) and debugging (inspect migrations, entity state).
- Set up CI/CD with linting, tests, and integration scenarios (multi-server migration, central lookup).
- Establish observability dashboards (Grafana/Prometheus) covering chunk tick times, migration latency, and network health.
- Automate chaos experiments and rolling failure drills to validate recovery procedures.

## 6. Long-Term Scalability

- Explore sharding strategies (regional clusters managed by the central service) and cross-region replication.
- Investigate MQTT/websocket layers for real-time client updates leveraging the delta stream.
- Prepare analytics pipelines (event logging, player movement, voxel changes) for tuning gameplay and infrastructure.
- Explore edge caching of voxel deltas via CDN-like nodes to reduce latency for distant regions.
- Research machine-learning assisted load forecasting to proactively scale chunk servers.
